# DepthEstimation-Olympe
In this repository, we share the code written in Olympe simulator for depth estimation. We intend to write a code that a drone is randomly fly in a room. Using a depth estimation algorithm, we detectability the nearby objects. As soon as the drone's distance is closer than a threshold, it changes its direction or stops to avoid collision avoidance.
